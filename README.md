# X1-NVM-open_IPs
# Neuromorphic & ReRAM NVM Project Gallery

Curated examples of projects that **use neuromorphic compute and/or ReRAM-based NVM** in meaningful ways (beyond simple scaffolds).  
This page highlights verified open-source designs, SoCs, or research demos integrating NVM-based synapses, loggers, and edge processors.

---

## ðŸ§  Inclusion Criteria
- Clear **application focus** (what it does).  
- Uses **ReRAM/NVM and/or neuromorphic** techniques meaningfully.  
- Public repositories with **real artifacts** (RTL, SoC glue, testbench, or verified documentation).
